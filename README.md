# lessql
Hacked version of less for use as a pager for sql client applications

If you use terminal sql client tools such as psql, mysql, or sqsh, you may also have made use of less to page the results. This utility adds one feature: the ability to anchor the column headers to the top of the output.

Best used like this:

```
lessql -SinFX
```
